# Lament Configurator
#### A CSS utility library for developing mobile-first, transformative responsive layouts

Lament Configurator is a CSS library intended to make developing UIs across different devices simpler.

You might want to use it in cases where your UI transforms across breakpoints:

- text is **center-aligned** on mobile but should be **left-** or **right-aligned** on tablet/desktop
- an element **isn't** floated on mobile but **should be** on tablet/desktop
- an element should explicitly be **shown** or **hidden** on a specific device

You get the idea!
